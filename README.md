Sahayak

This repository contains only the STATIC assets pertaining to the project. Due to an acute shortage of time , we were unable to add the larger files on 
this repository.

However we have provided the complete code in the form of a link of google drive as below -- 
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dxewpRTyYled3ojfo6AJjdnZv85_Z5cg

In order to run the project , we must start the main.js file at localhost:3000. Due to problem with integrating the api with vanilla JS ,
we decided to directly send data to frontend using res.send feature .

Given the time , we will try our best to integrate and esnsure proper fetching of the data by the frontend.
